Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace.

Either way it was a pity.	Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing.	2
He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes.	He unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it.	1

The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop.	it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant.	1
At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility.	The researchers pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop.	1
They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene.	Both genes are inserted into a few greenhouse plants.	4

An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market.	while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market.	1

these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless.	Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market.	2
that he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought.	Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls.	3
We do not share this approach.	it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country.	2
Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter.	Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a "third way": of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism.	1
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation.	a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause, rather than resolve, conflict.	3
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident.	Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress.	4
he rejected a socialist planned economy.	embraced the free market.	1
In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market.	he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management.	1

The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism.

For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery.	It means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant.	1

That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion than to $95 billion in 1988, and $55 billion (annualized) rather than $80 billion in the first quarter of 1989.	These revised figures may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar.	1

LTV challenged the order.	a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the plans.	1
The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans.	The appeals court said the agency had to consider a company's long-term ability to fund pension plans, not just short-term improved financial status.	1

Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist, inclined to defend floating rates to the death.	no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else.	3
By accounting definitions, this had to produce a sudden trade deficit.	As in the U.S., it produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling, that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates, M-Whatever.	1

To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses.	We should add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it.	1
We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it.	We should concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience.	1
Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates.	of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one.	3

Donald H. Straszheim surely understands.	a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast.	2
The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position.	he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction.	4
Mr. Straszheim expects he will take some heat.	he's right.	1
Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession.	In February 1988 Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989.	1
The forecasts were widely disseminated.	in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds.	1
long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989.	bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy.	2
and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds.	The firm raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%.	1
In February 1988, for example, Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989.	this September he took a detour if not a U-turn.	3
He softened the talk about a recession.	Now he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter.	1
Now, in fact, he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter.	just recently, Merrill Lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50%.	1
they aren't.	such changes might sound minor.	3
Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy.	that "it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time.	1
Pestered by bosses, brokers, clients and media people and pushed by their own egos, Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator.	the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast.	3
Some smaller clients don't seem to notice his switch.	with some clients, the talk can heat up a bit.	3
A good half-hour into breakfast at the Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien looks up from his plate.	Mr. Straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive.	4
He doesn't fully succeed.	Mr. Straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios.	3
Dennis O'Brien, the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, adopts a polite approach, waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast.	In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis the firm's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall.	3
Do we want to go through this.	can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be right.	1
Do we want to go through this.	can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be right.	1

that the new outlook, though still weak, doesn't justify calling a recession right now.	We could have a recession" at some point.	3
We're not running that ad campaign any more," Mr. Straszheim snaps in a rare show of irritation..He adds, "I think it was a fairly decent call.	Mr. Straszheim says It's hard to pin this on one factor.	4

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned.	Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters.	2
the dispute is worth examining.	there is an effort to "anchor the dollar" either to gold or other currencies.	2
Until his resignation, Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy.	the pound were tied to the mark.	1
Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.	Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%.	4
Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.	Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%.	4
Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.	he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher, through a long and costly effort, had subdued.	2
the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates.	the pound had been tied to the mark.	2
it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency.	a country cuts tax rates.	2
This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit.	Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row.	2
that the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.	the top tax rate was cut to 40%.	4
The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment.	emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates.	1
First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction.	when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate.	4
Then interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate.	the currency falls.	4
This policy is totally mindless.	Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies.	1
German reunification is likely to require Germany's neutralization.	the Soviet Union collapses.	1
The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering.	we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate.	4

Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading.	Their motivation has a strong practical aspect.	1
Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks.	Program trading causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market.	1
Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.	the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them.	1

Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman's recent Money Matters article ("Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts" Oct. 3), I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom.

I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time.	Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session.	3
That bill would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies, mandate large traders' reporting of program or block trades, and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets.	The bill would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden doesn't.	1

The complex bill covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated.	The bill elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct.	1
Many aspects of the bill are salutary, providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry.	some of the bill's requirements, including broad representation on the exchanges' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest, already have been put in place by the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges.	1

GM's common closed at $44.375 a share, down 50 cents, Ford fell 37.5 cents to end at $47.50.	Chrysler eased 37.5 cents to $22.25.	1

The inflation-growth argument is an old one.	Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence Fed policy.	3

Now, sterilized intervention may have some effect.	that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values.	3
After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing.	it's hard to see much impact on the dollar.	3
The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly.	whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know.	3
Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles.	and risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation.	2

Wall Street would like UAL Corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent.	what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company's two most powerful and fractious unions: the pilots and machinists.	3
that the collapse of the previous $6.79 billion buy-out, if anything, may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups.	both may now have virtual veto power over any UAL transaction.	2
One reason: banks probably will insist on labor harmony.	they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan.	4

If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue.	that's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at.	1
where the union would stand.	another bid or recapitalization became possible.	2
to be more aggressive.	a second buy-out attempt occurs.	2
The two unions already had significant leverage.	their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts.	2
That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work.	even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key.	2
the UAL board should be ousted.	it doesn't move soon to increase shareholder value.	2
The pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here.	whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries, the machinists, is another question.	3

On the other hand, the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle.	in recent days, machinists' union leaders have shown some new flexibility.	3

If a compromise can't be reached, the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists.	at this point, that may just be wishful thinking.	3
The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company..Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks.	The pilots' insistence on majority ownership may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve.	1

Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy, highlighted by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap.

Traders attribute the mark's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials.	they add that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments.	3

In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets.	this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans.	3

The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount.	a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student, regardless of family income, at market or near-market rates.	3

the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow.	the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring.	4
Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.	Trinity Rep is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters.	3
For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not.	Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques.	1
Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.	Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.	1
And "Summerfolk is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.	Along the way there are lots of romantic dalliances.	1
Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty.	beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce.	3
Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them.	they often literally stand on their heads.	1
Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors.	they were rag dolls.	1
even hanging them from precipices.	having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do.	4
The clash of ideologies survives this treatment.	the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle.	3
As for the humor that Gorky's text provides it looks and sounds forced.	repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble).	4

This became apparent.	game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded.	4
No human can examine millions of moves.	Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones.	3
After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980.	the computer didn't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly.	3

In such positions you have to create something new.	the computer isn't able to do that right now.	1

Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%.	10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%.	1
The CD seemed like a great deal.	nearly 3 1/2 years later, Merrill says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000.	3

Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent.	Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance.	1
The tip-off came.	he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD's "estimated current market value" had plummeted by $9,000 in a month.	4

the difference . . . is not insured.	the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market . . . is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs.	2
Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated.	you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant.	1
Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a "fact sheet" sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale.

It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP.

The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes.	the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services.	1

The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again.	the question faced by investors is: What is UAL stock worth.	4
That's.	airline earnings, like those of auto makers, have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy.	2
that, despite the huge drop in the stock, UAL hasn't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings.	anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover, and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event.	2
that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid "in the $225 area.	that it could take three to four months to close.	3
that UAL's board might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level.	it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal.	3
By that logic, the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months.	the eventual price might be higher.	3
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement funds.	On Friday, they persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them.	1
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement funds.	that banks aren't likely to lend the almost $5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17% in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July.	3
That way someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work.	they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs.	2
because they would be losing their money.	the banks lost theirs.	4
Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk, that is, subordinate to the bank debt in any deal.	Banks want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader.	1
One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders..The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions, using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking.	it isn't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders.	3
First Boston's estimates had been higher.	management supplied a 1989 projection.	4
Using estimates of the company's future earnings under a variety of scenarios, First Boston estimated UAL's value at $248 to $287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections; $237 to $275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA; $98 to $121 under an adverse labor settlement, and $229 to $270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike.	using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets, First Boston estimated the airline is worth $253 to $303 a share.	1

There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing.	here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges.	2
Not all exchanges accept every type of order.	even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange, a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer.	1

With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the market.	if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price.	1
For example a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price.	wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060.	2
that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers.	Profits realized from these trades would be shared by the conspiring brokers.	4
Limit orders are used.	investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment.	2
Investors may regret the restriction.	the stock reaches 54 and then falls.	2

Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order.	the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get.	1
Stop orders are sometimes called "stop-loss" orders.	they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses.	2
there is a difference.	stop orders sound similar to limit orders.	3
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price.	buy stops above.	1
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above.	sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below.	3
In contrast, sell limit orders must be placed above the market price.	buy limit orders are placed below.	1

which are filled at the market price.	the stop price is hit.	4
which are filled at the market price.	the stop price is hit.	4
it doesn't get filled.	it can't be made at that price.	2
Investors who wish to be out of a position, without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order, may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled.	if the market moves quickly enough, it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price.	3
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order.	the market moves quickly enough.	2
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order.	the investment has passed the specified price.	2

Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached.	unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price.	3
However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price.	a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it.	3
the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price.	the market trades at the specified price.	4

"Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading.

The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0.	a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on.	2
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas..Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market.	Remember that beta also has important limitations.	3
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret.	that beta has important limitations.	1
There is risk that is not associated with market moves.	the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that.	1
and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that.	beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock.	1
That "business" risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks.	it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio.	3
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock.	Beta is a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer.	1

People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension.	therein lies another aspect of investment risk: the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others.	3

that investors need to consider.	the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk..But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk..The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue.	1

The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio.	the bulk of the money is in a single issue.	2
Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by Seidman Financial Services, which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman.	one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility.	3

Of course, the greater volatility of the younger couple's portfolio doesn't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders' long-term goals.	the older couple's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return won't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans.	1

Over the past decade or two the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products, variations on products, and variations on the variations.	I was thinking about fox hunting.	4
that can be used in various ways.	the insured is still alive.	4
pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck, within limits.	all you want is death-benefit coverage.	2
If all you want is death-benefit coverage, pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck, within limits.	term" means just that.	3
and must be renewed.	it expires.	4
the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires.	It may stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal.	1
you may not be able to buy it.	you flunk.	2
your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older.	you're healthy and can renew.	2
your premium will go up sharply.	you're that much older.	2
But "term" means just that; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires..It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it..Even if you're healthy and can renew, your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older.	term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks.	2
One variation that appealed to me at first was the "Money Smart Term Life" policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co., the American Express unit, to the parent company's credit-card holders.	Upon examination I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense.	3
and would pay me back all the premiums I put in.	I canceled the policy after 10 years.	2
First I'd have no more insurance, a not insignificant consideration.	I canceled.	2
that would have exceeded the inflation rate.	and given the company a real profit.	2
to cancel.	which could lock in its investment profit.	4
to cancel.	which could lock in its investment profit.	4
That would be all right with Amex, which could then lock in its investment profit.	it doesn't add up to a "smart money" move for me.	3
I win -- a hollow victory.	I die early.	2
a hollow victory.	I can't enjoy it.	2
If I die early, I win -- a hollow victory, since I can't enjoy it.	if I live long, the insurer wins.	1
and the insurer wins.	I live long.	2
This is worth remembering.	insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance, the kind that amasses cash value.	4
The word "death" cannot be escaped entirely by the industry.	salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms, preferring to talk about "savings" and "investment" instead.	3
but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms.	preferring to talk about "savings" and "investment.	1
That's.	you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package.	2
to die.	under its protection.	4
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect, your share of the company's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection.	in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well.	1
That's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package.	view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment.	2
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage, the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing.	your cash value and dividends grow over the years.	1
the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy "loans.	none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment.	1
and none of the proceeds were taxable.	they included gains on investment.	3
Congress closed this loophole last year, or thought it did.	Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield, Mass., has developed a "combination plan" of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences.	3

However, Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield, Mass., has developed a "combination plan" of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences.	the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small.	3
I'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately.	I look into the broad category called universal life.	2
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year.	I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy.	1
and I can even skip payments.	my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy.	2
One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees (usually 4% to 4.5%).	the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment, often 8.5% or more.	3
Projecting the latter over several decades, I find my cash buildup is impressive.	can any high interest rate prevail for that long.	3
Projecting the latter over several decades, I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long?.Not likely, I think.	some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year..These are not certain, either.	1

he erred by stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor.	by stepping outside the state's pro-choice tradition, Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment.	1
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate.	by wavering on this issue and abortion, he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides.	1

First, there's the name: "asset-backed securities." Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing.	there's more.	1
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions..Most earn high ratings from credit agencies..Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues.	the booming market has already attracted many of the nation's biggest institutional investors.	1

Such concerns haven't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street's hottest new products.	3
They have sold issues backed by car loans, boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans..They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares..Last year, there was an issue of "death-backed bonds" -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders..Some predict there will be "Third World bonds," backed by loans to Brazil, Argentina and other debt-ridden nations.	the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables, sometimes known as "plastic bonds.	1
nothing will be left unhocked.	the sun sets on the '80s.	4
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers, pension funds, bank trust departments and other institutions.	wealthy individuals also have been jumping in, and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market.	3

The trust issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors.	4
Issues typically come with "credit enhancements," such as a bank letter of credit.	and have received high credit ratings.	2
the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers.	providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions.	4

That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street.	for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have, that margin is meaningless.	3

If you're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby, then even an extra 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) becomes an important consideration on a career basis.	if you're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again, then that isn't of overwhelming importance.	3

Moreover, the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable.	interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level.	3
That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states, such as New York or California.	Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts, such as retirement plans.	3

You could see massive gyrations here.	it's such a thinly traded market.	2
The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues.	an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings.	1
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem.	Investors may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities.	1
that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof.	if there's a problem, don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue.	1
In other words don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue.	there's a problem.	2

If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations.	that could affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports.	1
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions.	despite the credit enhancements, despite the high ratings, some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets.	3
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities, as well as make it tougher to unload the latter.	it could be much worse.	3
For one thing, credit-card loans are unsecured.	that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession.	1

Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities.	voting in office.	4
If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits.	their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies.	1
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535.	it comes to national policy making.	2

Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society.	the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.	1
Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office.	first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat.	1
they were more vulnerable to defeat.	these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role in national policy making.	2
First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.	the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.	1
Since local benefit-seeking matters more.	national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress.	1
this is precisely the pattern one would expect.	Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts.	2
Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.	the key assumption is valid.	2

Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.	This is what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.	1
First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do..To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns..Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking..This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.	as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.	1

Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.	An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands) reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff.	1

State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse.	that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.	1

Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level.	at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation.	1

In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management, Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union's role in subcontracting, long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings.	with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina, government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment.	1

Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22% increase in compensation.	Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract.	3
Pemex officials wouldn't say how much money the new contract would save the company.	one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $500 million a year.	3
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract.	Pemex's customers are pleased with the company's new spirit.	1

The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money.	he is a political agent of a political president, who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election, and less to its longer-run health.	1
Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level.	would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates, short-run economic expansion, and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels.	1

To leave this decision to an "independent" agency is not only undemocratic.	It prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale.	1
It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale.	it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters, the politicians, who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy.	2

Congress would be required to make a hard decision.	Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact.	3
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives, in addition to stabilizing the price level, which is true.	that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives.	3

But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability.	the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level.	1
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth.	the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals, the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation.	3

By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment.	Government statistics show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2%.	1

Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz, knocked down buildings in San Francisco's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District.	Just a short span across the bay to the west, the quake showed its mettle.	1

I don't think so.	Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker.	2
There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the East German leadership.	Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups.	1

Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow..He was a "socialist warrior" who felt rankled by West Germany's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state.	during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought.	1

It doesn't make sense to parachute out at this price," Mr. Steinhardt says.	he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers' "operating skills.	3

In recent days USAir has been buying its own shares, as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares.	the carrier won't discuss its buy-back program.	3
that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out.	USAir stepped up its share purchases.	2
If USAir stepped up its share purchases, that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out.	USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt.	3
In 1987, USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled.	Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier.	4
Mr. Icahn, a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt, eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear, Stearns.	Mr. Steinhardt could take that route.	1
Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route.	with airline stocks cratering, he might not get a very good price for his shares.	3
its defenses, including the sale in August of a 12% stake in the company to Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, are pretty strong.	USAir isn't considered absolutely takeover-proof.	3
Since last April, the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir.	he bought and sold the company's stock.	4
Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company's managers, and to stir interest in the stock.	of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company.	3

The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well.	local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994.	2
Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles, Mr. O'Connell explained.	why even consider stacking freeways now.	2
We've run out of places to build freeways in L.A.	the only place to go is up.	2
and the only place to go is up.	there are many obstacles, including cost.	3
there are many obstacles, including cost.	as for safety double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale.	3
Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday.	most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or "liquefy," in a major quake.	3
they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that run horizontally through the column.	the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement.	3
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes, with spiraling steel rods inside.	in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below.	3
Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration.	it was just something the structure couldn't withstand.	1
Ironically, Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time wrapping freeway columns in "steel blankets" to reinforce them.	only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported by double rows, was left out.	3

Ultimately, whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options..That cost rises in times of high market volatility.	it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit.	3
A call option is similar to a put.	that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration.	1

A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City.	so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT).	2

would the water be quite so hot.	Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers.	2
It probably would.	few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.	2
because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.	some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.	1
In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.	the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur..People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck.	1
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog.	it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves.	1
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.	wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.	3
Why constructive.	despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.	2
Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity.	honest differences were allowed to simmer.	2
group conflicts still exist.	what other means do we have for letting off steam.	2
if group conflicts still exist.	if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe.	1
Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe.	and what other means do we have for letting off steam.	2
Don't say the TV sitcom.	that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy.	2
that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show.	these are not the differences that make headlines.	3
that the plot has entered the public domain.	it has remained there.	1
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over.	whether it will simmer at all.	3
To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them.	Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.	1
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie.	he's a shrewd Jewish businessman.	2

For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie.	but he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.	2
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself.	too often, these routines lack spark.	3
But too often, these routines lack spark.	this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade-ethnic differences.	2
That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up.	it can simmer.	4
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.	I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.	3

This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify.	in a criminal case, a prosecutor cannot comment on a defendant's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness, thus forcing him to "take the Fifth.	2

that "the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause."

Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth.	his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.	1
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter.	he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.	2
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter.	because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.	3
