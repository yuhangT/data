Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90% of their usual capacity, but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled, leaving the previously full hotel with an 80% vacancy rate.City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled.Among the city's banks, Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open.The closed branches, in San Francisco, Hayward, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, sustained structural damage.Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line.Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America's Concord office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles, the bank said. Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee -- which met all night Tuesday -- moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte, Calif., 500 miles to the south.Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed, while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order. The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake's epicenter, 80 miles south of San Francisco.Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $600 million.Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $504 million, excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos. Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I-880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in Oakland, causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake. San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total $2 billion.That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations.Many streets and sidewalks buckled, and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured. The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration, according to Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.). FEMA, which coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Carolinas last month.It is likely to get as much as $800 million initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than $1 billion, according to Mr. Fazio, a member of the House Appropriations Committee. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements.The Bush administration has at its disposal $273 million in funds remaining from the $1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo. "We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate, short-term requirements," Mr. Fitzwater said.He added that the Office of Management and Budget, the Transportation Department and other agencies are "developing longer-term legislation" that should be ready soon. Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges.California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state. Some things can't be repaired.The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $10 million to $15 million in damage, including shattered porcelains and stone figures.Its neighbor, the De Young Museum, totaled $3 million to $5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture. The city's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls, and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor. The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake, wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.At San Francisco International Airport, shock waves wrecked the control tower, knocking down computers and shattering glass.Offices of the city's Rent Board were destroyed. Mayor Agnos's $2 billion estimate doesn't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city, some of which remained closed.A major chunk of the $2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency, said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos. "All of the city's $5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours" on overtime salaries, he said. Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices. At Fireman's Fund Corp., a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake, and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area. "Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant," a spokesman said. "We're delivering a check for $750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday." Fireman's is part of a $38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge, which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income. California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster, as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads. In addition, under the highway-relief program, the federal government provides 100% of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.After that, the federal share diminishes.For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to 90% of the cost of repairs, and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100% federal funding for several months. Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to an aide to Rep. Fazio	the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number (800-462-9029) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake	1

they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin, which could be used as a safe vaccine	they have been able to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium.It turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin, only one was responsible for the toxin's virulence. Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes, minus the one that caused the virulence, would have been transferred to another bacterium, called E. coli, which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin they did this, but the toxin didn't induce immunity to whooping cough. The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence.Then, using a new technique (called homologous recombination) for introducing genes into cells, they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism.These bacterial "cousins" ordinarily don't make the toxin.But the genes were accompanied by a piece of DNA, called a promoter, that turns the genes on. The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which, because of the mutant virulence gene, was no longer toxic	1

that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter: PASOK, whether guilty or not, can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou's expense	With regard to Greece's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal, Mr. Papandreou's principal accuser remains George Koskotas, former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in Salem, Mass., from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece.Mr. Koskotas's credibility is, at best, problematic.He has ample motive to shift the blame, and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points.Nevertheless, the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity. Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $734,000 in bribes, as contended; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $57 million in Mr. Koskotas's bank and then skim off the interest; and, what PASOK's cut was from the $210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched. Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court.But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers.In the end, the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and "indications" that point to PASOK, not clinching proof. On another issue, Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency, the EYP, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures, including key opposition politicians, journalists and PASOK cabinet members.Despite convincing arguments, it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps. The central weakness of the "scandals" debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks.The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France's Avions Marcel Dassault, respectively.Naturally, neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid (or not) to various Greek officials for services rendered	0
