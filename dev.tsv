The bill would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget.	to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization.	1
But the RTC also requires "working" capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold.	That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold.	4
It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved.	The agency has already spent roughly $19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls, and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes.	2
Absent other working capital the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets.	We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward.	1
That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian.	The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility.	1
Just days after the 1987 crash, major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors.	This time around, they're moving even faster.	3
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night.	Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today.	1
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night..Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today.	Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads.	1
It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday.	Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies.	1
It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday.	Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies.	1
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around.	This time, the firms were ready.	2
Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge.	When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers.	4
A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us.	To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial.	2
To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial.	It would have been too late to think about on Friday.	3
It would have been too late to think about on Friday.	We had to think about it ahead of time.	2
Today's Fidelity ad goes a step further, encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity.	Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility." It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name.	1

PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash.	In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house, ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night.	1
The new PaineWebber commercial features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.	Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, "We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle. . . . We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation.	1
We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle.	We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation.	1

If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed.	This isn't 1987 revisited.	1
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday, investment firms had to constantly revise their approach.	At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon.	1
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday, Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad.	We don't think at this point anything needs to be said.	2
We don't think at this point anything needs to be said.	The market seems to be straightening out.	2

Mr. Eskandarian becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold.	John Verret, the agency's president and chief executive, will retain the title of president.	3

and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.	The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A's.	1
In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.	He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed.	1
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup.	If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen.	2
On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.	Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.	1
Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.	The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision.	1
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all.	That's not an average to soothe Giant rooters.	1
but they observe them in relative calm.	Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see.	1
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams.	I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday..I love 'em both..The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games," said David Williams, a Sacramento septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go.	1
I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.	I love 'em both.	1
I love 'em both.	The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games.	2
although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else.	Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans.	3
Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for.	In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.	1
there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.	He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three-run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally.	1
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season, the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph.	Not his autograph.	3
An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation.	He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run.	1

They combined for 25 hits, six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs.	They went a collective 5-for-24 here, with zero homers and ribbies.	3
It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come.	I believe in the law of averages.	2

After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose.	The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.	1

If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour.	if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.	1
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic.	A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself..But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices.	2
What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds.	The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes, after the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points, or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index..Options markets stopped trading in many securities..The New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, remained open..With nowhere else to go, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange..As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply.	1

With nowhere else to go, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange.	As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply.	4
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange, the futures markets and the options markets, though physically separate, have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively.	Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them.	2
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers.	To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility, either all markets should be open to trading or none.	3
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday, but they probably would have made for smoother, less volatile executions.	It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open.	2
It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open.	Let's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline.	2
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies.

The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing.

The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday's dramatic march for several weeks.

These are all market excesses (putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity), and what we've seen is the market reining them in.	Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday.	1

Within the Senate, the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative.	The measure is attached to the more than $26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg's jurisdiction, and the final compromise is laced with more than $205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports, including Denver.	2
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states, such as North Carolina.	Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House.	1

It was a pretty wild day.	Our markets were closely tied to the stock market.	2
The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2%.	The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%.	1
In fact, some economists contend that the latest easing started last week.	Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing.	1
The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities.	After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday, they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday.	1

The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March.	The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator, which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100.	1
In contrast, the Commerce Department's widely followed index of leading indicators, while up in August, has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year.	Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year's end.	2
the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well.	They expect a 2.6% rise in 1990 in the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation.	1
Underlying this optimism is the index's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries, as the case may be, by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.	Over the full post-World War II era, the Columbia index, on the average, has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries.	1
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved, had it existed, in 1929, before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression.	The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash.	1

To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa.
